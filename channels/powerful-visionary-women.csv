Should you be interested in hearing from a few fellow powerful visionary women  in our community of Rare Ones we'd love to introduce you to them. #TeamRareBirds will be hosting our first community event in about two weeks. Linda, Marina and Juhee will be leading their own tables on the following topics (see flyer for details). Should you be interested in attending to meet them, we'd be happy to facilitate. Of course the chaps are equally as interesting and lovely:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: . You could meet them too:-) :dart::tada: Otherwise, hope life post-KERNEL is being good to you.

Your mom. The mentor who believes in you. The rival who pushes you to new heights. _The 85-year-old neighbor who’s learning how to code._
We all have them: people — both fictional and real — who have helped us see, strive for, and become better versions of ourselves. Today we’ll share who has earned our admiration and inspired us in our lives.

*CryptoChicks Hatchery online program* is *welcoming new female founders to incubate their blockchain startups with a help of business building curriculum and mentorship help of successful blockchain entrepreneurs*. Please see the information deck <https://bit.ly/CCHatcheryFounder2020> and website <https://cryptochickshatchery.com> for more information.

*My experience*
I attended the program last year with its first cohort with a different project. The commitment is low-key - you choose your schedule to speak to the mentors and you present about your progress during the scheduled meeting times (once a quarter). The program also started to get funding as well and we had an opportunity to onboard a summer intern that they would pay a stipend for but we didn’t pursue it. Overall, a good addition to an accelerator or if you are looking for more marketing and to make more connections but don’t expect lots of funding or an intensive program.
