really recommend this episode of the Joe Rogan podcast with Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman (@hubermanlab on Instagram):
<http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/andrew-huberman>

His lab at Stanford focuses on sleep, stress and learning - more specifically how we can tap into those seemingly unconscious systems and get better at them. 

The most important trigger combination for learning (neuroplasticity) at an age above 25 is the sense of *urgency* (produced by fear, an ice bath, breathing exercises etc.) and *focus* (even visually zooming into something specific). Those two actions, which we also perceive as *attention* trigger neuroplastic events, which then happen at an increased speed in our brains while we sleep or in states of *deep rest* (hypnosis, yoga nidra, meditation).

at some point, we might feel like we burn out or stressed and need rest, because we don’t have attention forever. it turns out that our brain actually counts the release of chemicals responsible for the actions above. but *joy, happyness and fun activities* can push back this counter and make is do even more.

they obviously talk more about how to make use of these actions and their chemical interactions (noradrenaline, acetylcholine and dopamine) but in general these strategies can help a lot in making more of our stressful days.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:20:17 GMT",1596017749.016200,,"[{""name"":""heart"",""users"":[""U01733WAA1F""],""count"":1}]",1

I think the reaction is kind of up to you, it seems difficult for me to say how to do it “right”. but my observation so far was that yes, given the context that someone doesn’t feel good we try to be careful when writing because everything might get misinterpreted.

I think the same goes for if someone is consistently unhappy. How would you treat your friends if they were unhappy? I would probably approach them and start a conversation, even if it feels uncomfortable.

You are a great leader, and it must be so much fun to work with you! This is a polar opposite to what I have experienced during my employment.

What also spawns immediately to my mind is that what if you hire someone who appears to be one person, but then it turns out that they are kind of exploiting (a bit of a strong word, for the lack of the more appropriate one) you for your kindness, say they have noticed that if they are consistently unhappy then you are overly understanding and caring to them, and they use that to their advantage. Maybe this is a bit out of context question, actually. And I suppose you would just talk to them about the situation, and if they repeat this again on purpose, you just fire them?","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:20:25 GMT",1596011809.009800,,,0
1596026001.017600,U0176E6JUMA,"Good question! It’s pretty tough and obviously people are different but eventually you will always have to deal with humans, no matter what.

I think the easiest answer is that with each person you meet you get better at picking up on subtleties and can predict their behaviour.

If someone doesn’t react as I expected, I normally try to talk to them as quickly as possible and try to understand where my suspicion comes from. In a case of someone exploiting you it might seem difficult to be honest at first, but it’s super important to talk about it.

If someone I work with exploits me and wastes my time or money, I explain that I have less time for other things, which means that I can’t work full capacity, which means that the person eventually gets less from me. So I have to communicate these boundaries.

If someone is unhappy I try explain it from the same resource-management perspective. I’m happy to point them towards therapy but if it starts costing me too much work, we will have to find a compromise.

I guess my approach is relatively time-intensive but insures that you learn with each interaction and expands your checklist when hiring new people.

The alternative is making a quick decision and firing, where you won’t learn about yourself, but it is helpful in stressful situations or when you don’t have time to reflect.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:20:26 GMT",1596011809.009800,,,0
1596026680.017800,U016M08G1M4,"This is so valuable. Thank you

I am compelled to direct the question into the organisational category now, is that OK? If so,

do you ever do performance reviews at your company? I am wondering what you would do if you saw that the person is underperforming and you know that they can do better, but they are just a little bit lazy sometimes. Would you explain this to them and hope they improve? What if they do not improve and they are purposely under-performing

An example would be assigning a task to write a page for the front-end and then you see a ton of bugs that are not “deep” at all, like super simple stuff, that could have been avoided by just going to the page and checking that everything works as expected?","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:20:26 GMT",1596011809.009800,,,0
1596029121.018000,U0176E6JUMA,"Sure, feel free to forward.

I'll try to answer this in detail later but on one hand I generally see these kinds of situations from a different perspective. If someone underperforms, then I made a mistake somewhere in the hiring process. I don't think there's really another way to see it, so I'm trying to find the point where I made the mistake and immediately try to fix it so it doesn't happen again.

For instance last time that happened, the ""underperforming"" employee's grandmother died. It's not their fault, it's circumstances. So now I ask everyone (even clients and contractors) to share their mood/health every day and approach them if it's not good, take over if there's time pressure or prolong the deadline of a project.

And the second part is damage control, so depending on the context you need to re-negotiate the relationship you have with the person who isn't acting as expected. If you think that it will cost you too much effort in the long term, you need to figure out how fast you can get out of the situation without creating more chaos. This might make you re-think the terms under which you hire people, too.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:20:29 GMT",1596011809.009800,,"[{""name"":""clap"",""users"":[""U016M08G1M4""],""count"":1}]",1
