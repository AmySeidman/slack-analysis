Coming mainly from alignments w/ the DaDa ""invisible economy whitepaper."" It affirmed our independent whitepaper draft, that posits a tangible return to indigenous modes of exchange &amp; trade via PoX, FTs then NFTs once self sustainability is achieved. Primavera being one of our core references on long term blockchain based systems; her review of DaDa's almost identical model for art markets, gives us very good feelings. And we hope to work w/her via MITs Fabacademy connection soon!

Not only will your work help us experiment &amp; hopefully implement a tangible return to indigenous modes of trade n exchange via barter contracts. But the women in this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7qML81Akus&amp;feature=youtu.be|video> layout a beautiful means of important indigenous alignments of commons at the organization *model level;* along with intrinsic value(s) distribution trends tracking..via indigenous modes of exchange tracking.

Pretty cool IDE &amp; drag n drop SC writing tools for the current Stacks2 testnet. Along with a tool for wallet management.

Also to Vinay Gupta's point on the vulnerabilities of Solidity in recent airmeet. Vinay has been pivotal for our understanding of the full scope of blockchain based systems. Especially in context of the next iterations of world trade.
Here is good work from Jude Nelson, Princeton engineer for Stacks core, on advantages of <https://blog.blockstack.org/bringing-clarity-to-8-dangerous-smart-contract-vulnerabilities/|Clarity SC language>.

Also worth noting Blockstack has been in careful R+D since early days of BTC! Slow n steady has proven to have some big legal &amp; security advantages, as a very powerful mainnet release gears up. A unique capacity for security &amp; scalability in the important work of this jam may prove worth at least diversifying protocol models.

1594392101.013000,U016M08G1M4,"I can give input on the first part, but not the second, because I don’t think I understand the second part correctly to be able to comment

From the brief stint for Ocean, as you have said <@U0169FVV2LF>, I had to write the kubernetes pod that would run in between the algorithm pod (the bit where your algo runs on someone’s data) and the publish pod (the bit that is responsible for publishing the results). For those unfamiliar with pods, for the purposes of this explanation, you can assume it to be like a Docker container. For those unfamiliar with Docker, just think about the pods as some applications.

Algorithm runs on data app -&gt; data leakage prevention app -&gt; publish results app

There were a number of conditions that I had to fulfil:

1. published data is not a 1-1 copy
2. results not correlated to inputs
3. published results are not encrypted
4. published results do not contain some keywords
3. is fairly easy to identify with Shannon’s entropy. You can check out my submission repo for this. The idea is that if the data is encrypted, then its entropy is high

1 and 4 are trivial. 4 I have implemented per environment per data category. For example, for production environment for maths data cateogry you get different keywords than you do for development environment for the same category. I have done this from the perspective that you might want to use different keywords for developing / testing.

Not correlated outputs is a controversial one. First of all, you may have multiple output files (the user can do whatever they want to do in their algorithm in Ocean), as well as inputs. Plus, what threshold would you set for this. It must be different for different data. If we take a step back, is this really a good / strong condition for preventing the leaks? Probably, not. It is too complex to properly define. My approach was generalist. To meet the requirements of the task, I have simply used block entropy correlation. I compare entropies of blocks of bytes in a single input to a single output. This solves the problem of different file types. But has a limitation that you must have a single input and a single output.

My personal insights after completing this task:

1. this is an incredibly difficult task, and will certainly require adjusting a few parameters from time to time
2. I don’t think making the conditions you use open source (the code) is a good idea. Because malicious agents can then more easily game you.
3. Someone popped up in Ocean’s Discord when I finished the hack and asked about why they aren’t looking at WhiteNoise DP. Haven’t looked myself, but would be interested to know how it would aid in Data Protection.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 10:53:12 GMT",1594345722.009700,,,0
