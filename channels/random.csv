1598442376.044700,U0172CB3649,"This last KERNEL module was very dense and stimulating and brought me back to some old topics of research/reflection.
Here I share some references/suggestions that came to my mind.

`On the *performativity of language*` as introduced in <https://kernel.community/module-5/incentives/#persuasion|module 5> (“What constitutes persuasive language? Words which perform what they say.“) and `the *inertia of language*` that hides our unconscious internalisation of old paradigms (or, better, the ideologies that substantiate them), topic of <https://kernel.community/module-7/no-paradigm/|module 7> I would like to make a connection with the work of the famous French sociologist, *Pierre Bourdieu* (1930 – 2002) which elaborated the very influential theory of _<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu#Theory_of_habitus|habitus>_<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu#Theory_of_habitus| and its >_<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu#Theory_of_habitus|embodiment>_, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu#Symbolic_capital|symbolic capital> and finally <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_violence#Language|symbolic violence>.
In Bourdieu’s idea relations of domination in society are _reinforced through_ symbolic media, such as _language_, where even the ‘oppressed’ groups _unconsciously_ reiterate their status quo of their subordination with the use of the language of the dominants. This happens because of the _performative nature of speech acts_. I remember <@U016Q117G67> stressing very nicely this point of *the importance of using an appropriate language* in one of the KERNEL Fireside (now I can’t recall which one of them).

I cite (to amplify) <https://kernel.community/module-7/no-paradigm/|this passage> that I really liked from this final module:

_*Our history can be seen as the retroactive telling of various paradigmatic stories*;_
&gt; _their inception, flourishing, and collapse; and how there always has been a new paradigm waiting to substitute for the collapsed one. These stories do not, however, sufficiently emphasize a recurrent and ubiquitous phenomenon [...] This phenomenon is best described as *the inertia of language*._
_This inertia is both a symptom of paradigmatic stories, and *the dynamic force behind their telling*. It can be traced through facts like how the sun still “rises”, even though we have known that it is the Earth’s horizon which dips into dawn, and rises into darkness._
&gt; _Due to this inertia, language stores and offers for communicative usage many remnants of many obsolete paradigms._
_*If we accept these remnants in what we write, speak or hear, then we subject ourselves* to the unstoppable inertia behind it. This is something for which we must take individual responsibility:_
&gt; _In human society language is so powerful that only violence can stop it. Where its power fails to serve my desires, it would be a mistake to blame such failure on the weakness of language. Rather *I should blame the weakness of my relation to language*. If I fail to notice that I think and speak, under the influence of language, *in patterns and constructs accumulated and preserved* in the junkyards of long since vanished paradigms, then this shows my lack of consciousness with regard to just *that power with which language can quickly make me spokesman for ideologies*, in which everybody is almost always “right” at the “wrong” time._
Connected to the “power of language”  here a nice *TED talk by* cognitive scientist *Lera Boroditsky* who conducts studies on _<https://www.ted.com/talks/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think?language=en|How language shapes the way we think>_ (and, I would say the other way around too, how we can see through the cultural differences across language semantics how words embody specific cultural beliefs and and way of representing the world).

Finally, still in relationship to performative speech and also *`horizontal conversations`*, I would like to propose a concept in philosophy of language and in particular of pragmatic theory, the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle|cooperative principle> mainly represented by *Paul Grice*’s <https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html|four Maxims on Conversation>:
1. *The maxim of quantity* (_Don’t give more information or less than needed_)
2. *The maxim of quality (*_Try to make your contribution one that is true)_
3. *The maxim of relation (*_Be relevant)_
4. *The maxim of manner* (_Avoid ambiguity, obscurity of expression and unnecessary prolixity_)
I think those maxims are fundamental for the ethics in a conversation that wants to be peer-to-peer, transparent and positive-sum where “<https://kernel.community/module-0/conversation/|Participants share trust, living within the same context>”.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 12:00:42 GMT",1598442376.044700,,"[{""name"":""heart"",""users"":[""U016C8XH6NR"",""U0172CM3049"",""U016C909613"",""U016Q1J7Y83"",""U017G0TNCFN"",""U016Z7XQC7N""],""count"":6},{""name"":""sparkles"",""users"":[""U0172CM3049"",""U016C909613"",""U017G0TNCFN""],""count"":3},{""name"":""seedling"",""users"":[""U01691XLMD5""],""count"":1}]",10

1595530665.248100,U016KTNL5QW,"been thinking about <@U0173GGMBJQ> point regarding the context shift of free speech when attention was assumed to be abundant. If crypto solves the use case of ""scarce digital asset"" (signals) then money (defi) and agency/voting (daos) seem to be obvious use cases.

Attention seems to be a 3rd use case BUT traditional/online advertising seems to be technology dependent (broadcast tech - channeling my inner McLuhan). I guess tx volume is a signal? As gas prices increases and L2 becomes a thing, the tracking of signed messages will accrue value? Are there any projects measuring ""interaction rate"" (signed messages)?","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:12:10 GMT",1595530665.248100,U0173GGMBJQ,,0
1595532495.248200,U016VVB0R7E,"Roll has talked about using personal tokens as measurements of engagement.

In the Kernel Slack, both <@U016HPVFV54> and <@U017E8XAW0G> have given away tokens as they test out the platform.

If attention is the scarce resource, then it's the audience who should be paid to consume it. Look at the timeshare model, you get a free hotel stay to listen to a hard sales pitch. This track talks about network harmful speech costing more, but take that a step back to the existing world.

feel free to ping Tony directly if you want to put some minds together or comment below :brain: :point_down:

• A restricted membership public group chat that verifies members (e.g. sign in with twitter) but keeps those in the discussion pseudonymous (can bootstrap w/o zk but the truly private one will probably need it?) 
[<@U016KTNL5QW> <@U01758R70F3> <@U016PNPMFSN> with Uni + Collab Land seem to be interested here]

• A generalized version of James’ wrapper contract (<https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1281250299206721536?s=20>) and other primitives to minimize socialization of losses due to censorable collateral (and other collateral related failures)
<@U0169G0QPAB> <@U016SRXDNP5> something Zapper / DeFi Dashboard could perhaps work towards? not sure how this fits on the roadmaps + open to other <#C017TA4K96V|defi> projects chiming in

• Compound governance modules as a service (maybe just open source library of contracts)
• Use an ETH address as a log-in but protect the privacy of the user. So verify ownership and then selectively reveal/conceal information. Or maybe it’s like OAuth privs where “this app would like to view your USDC tx history.”
