1597758763.060100,U016PVCCZDG,"As an author as well as an art lover, I must say I am very far from James Baldwin’s view as expressed in these lines. 

Human Art is a P2P affair. Understanding “The Artist” as someone different from those who are not creators of Art is a self-conscious way to set a distance between some inspired “divine” human beings and “the people”, “they”, who are thereArtists took the place of God in the XIXth century and the consequences are obvious in the XXth. The distance became so large that “the people” disconnected from “the artist” and turned to popular culture providers instead, and these became “the artists”. 

Any artist, who has developed the skills and has trained to express his/her unique human experience, is providing any human being who approaches his art work (a piece of music, a writing, an image...) the means for direct human communication. For me, Art is excellence in human communication, and the best art pieces are timeless because they are genuinely human and can connect human experiences through times and societies. Societies for art are just the context, some background... For an author like me the audience, the public, is just the sum of individuals. I always think of individual human beings, because “societies” doesn’t feel, suffer neither enjoy... and “society” is a socio-economic concept which is constantly used and abused. I don’t expect any society to take any purposeful action. Let’s better talk about Humanity as the sum of individual unique human beings. 

Whenever I find a text, a piece of music, or other art piece that I feel close to I am grateful to it’s author, the writer, musician, performer or whatever. Artists as such offer everyone of us their very refined senses to reveal out own common humanity, and doing so they help us open our eyes, ears, minds and heart providing the opportunity of connecting with ourselves better (a lifetime adventure). They are necessary and will always be as long as humans don’t give up on their unique humanity. I am glad that the Internet of Value can provide the ways for them to be rewarded for their invaluable work. 

As you can imagine I am not interested in Art neither in technology a means for shaping societies and serving political ideas. I think both can be beyond politics and I wish for them to be at the service of Humanity.

1597767663.060500,U01733WAA1F,"I must admit that when I see the term 'artist', the visuals in my head are the popular culture ones! I do agree with James Baldwin's take on artists being the ones who challenge the norm.

1597870740.098000,U016PVCCZDG,"Yes, creative processes are surely different for popular artists than for “professionally trained ones”, like the classical musicians I have been had the luck to work with for more than 20 years. For them Art is all about genuine expression though highly demanding performances, art pieces... As far as I know, artists try to express that side of our humanity often hidden inside most of us. They don’t see reality differently, they just take the time to observe and analyze it, and they dig into deep emotions and feelings, and they reveal our common sufferings and pleasures.
Art is an invitation to reconnect with yourself. This is the reason art is so therapeutical, but for many this can also open some Pandora’s boxes, and thus invoke rejection. Art is actually powerful, and it has been used for good and for bad. In history. In the XXth century “societies” have been tamed by Art and Music used as propaganda (Hitler and Stalin being examples of that). This is one more reason for me not to like artists in politics. I actually think they can do much better for Humanity recalling us what we all have in common, and help us improve individually... they are very well placed to make impact P2P and let networks, incentives etc. spread the word.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:51:10 GMT",1597715172.014000,,,0

Let's not even bring in blockchain yet. What happens if I use that rook as my piece in monopoly? Is it still a rook? It's in game procedures have definitely changed. But has it changed as a thing?
