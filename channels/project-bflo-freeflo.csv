Helloo all! Our build is on! We have worked with our partner RSN on their verification standard and processes to confirm. It's been great to affirm what we are building is relevant to the real world use case of global divestment of cotton from supply chain.

1595879031.000200,U016Z7XQC7N,"Hey Folks - looking for folks to participate in a mini market research study around our project mid week.

Freeflo is the safeguard system for BFLO to provide risk management for buyers of fiber with verification of slavery free commodities. We are building the grievance mechanism to demonstrate methods of inputs for ground truth with the use case of Chinaâ€™s Uighur ethic group currently being challenged due to forced labor conditions. 

We are working with a coalition of NGOs focused on this project.

While we arenâ€™t ready for used testing as this is a new project associated with our protocol, Iâ€™m opening up our ask for feedback loops to scout on folks willing to do a mini market research study of:

-  brand customers (we all buy clothes), 
- as well as a powerful service for social justice here at home 

In addition to feedback on the Uighur cotton project, weâ€™d love to hear thoughts of folks on the use of the system for other applications.

1596110468.003200,UN4CVDLJ3,They basically have the ability to produce high grade cotton in a way that uses 90% less water and no pesticides. I've been helping them flesh out their blockchain tracking integration as well. It'd be interesting if you could integrate their results into your SDG tracker as the cotton is grown also locally in the UK. So no shipping from Asia required. They want to track specific batches as well all the way through the cotton supply chain.
