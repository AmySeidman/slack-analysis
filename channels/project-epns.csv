`this is for every dApp, right? i wonder if *actual* subscriptions could also fit into this paradigm (imagine a netflix subscription) :open_mouth:`

Yes, for dApp or any service. They can also subscribe the users but in that case they pay the users (since it’s not a direct action by the user). I would love to explore the netflix subscription model and what you have in mind regarding that :slightly_smiling_face:

`also, can you connect here via web3modal? i'm not sure here but i do think getting the UX as seamless as possible to kickoff /manage notifications is super important and has the potential to be *way* better than Web2 experiences`

The interface was for mobile users and is changing to just import public key, we do have web3-react on the dApp side. For mobile app of ours (which is just one way to receive notifications), user can import public key and if they want to see encrypted notification, then they will have to authenticate with their private key (I hope I am making sense :sweat_smile:)","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:10:25 GMT",1595425066.004900,U016C909613,,0

if there’s anyone else at status / outside of the cohort you’d like to discuss with on this let us know, i think its an extremely interesting idea
