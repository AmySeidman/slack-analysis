It's Alex here, from Italy, I'm a serial entrepreneur, and the director of <https://mracrypto.com|MRA Crypto>.
My main focus is on *Distributed Governance* and *Collaborative Economics*, and in the last 4 years I've been helping developers and innovators to design and implement novel mechanisms of governance and tokenomics to support their distributed tech innovation.

I'm happy to start this new partnership with Gitcoin, and support this amazing, disruptive community.
Feel free to get in touch for any feedback and support in these areas :thumbsup:

Currently co-founder and CEO at Pods, doing options on Ethereum.
I have a finance background - worked for investment banks, hedge funds, trading desks... until I realized that traditional finance was on the edge of a radical change. I left the bank to pursue that change and found blockchain. Passionated about DeFi and economy.

You know how the KERNEL Application form talks about outsiders? Like those with hardly any background in Ethereum? Well that's me. Hello! :wave:

I'm an overzealous full-stack open source enthusiast, who mainly focuses in React and React Native frontend development. I work as a software developer by day, and by night I try to push the limits of the technologies I'm passionate about. :two_hearts:

Some useful facts about me: I've lead development on a few mobile apps that have reached over a million monthly active sessions, launched a <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.cawfree.earth&amp;hl=en_GB|social media platform> single-handedly, recently published <https://github.com/cawfree/web3-react-native|web3-react-native> and have even programmed a particle accelerator. :atom_symbol:

I'm still feeling around for ideas, I've a couple of my own mostly focused on increasing the ubiquity of Web3 in mobile applications, but ideally I'd be really interested in teaming up with someone who has a strong background in defi who is just dying to turn their brilliant idea into a reality. :bulb:

Before 2017/18, my background primarily revolved around the use of data analytics to establish psychological constructs. I then spent some time with a short lived professional gaming career before making the leap from data analysis to fintech when founding Nescience as an outlet for the tools I had begun to develop for the community.

At Nescience I developed an open-source rebalancing &amp; direct indexing tool, the only current solution that keeps your API keys client side.
In addition, we released a propriety order-splitting algorithm which significantly increases market-making efficiency.

At EthDenver this year, I began the development of DefiHedge, a decentralized platform/protocol for fixed-rate lending &amp; interest-rate derivatives, built on top of Compound.
I feel that interest-rate derivates are a natural progression in DeFi, and believe that rate-swaps, as the worlds most liquid derivatives, could propel DeFi far beyond its current status.
At this point in time, I have completed the design &amp; implementation of the protocol (hybrid orderbook allowing both off-chain order &amp; contract-fillable liquidity), and have moved on to the development of an exchange interface.

If anyone is intrigued by the project and has experience with best-practices while building an exchange using React, please reach out!
Also, if anyone has worked with libp2p and would like to contribute, we plan to implement a libp2p based relayer system similar to the 0x project, and will definitely be needing some help!","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 10:50:34 GMT",,,"[{""name"":""raised_hands"",""users"":[""U016C8XH6NR"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U0172CTQ3A5"",""U016C909613"",""U01692CEFQF"",""U016AMDF215"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U017LMXPJF5""],""count"":8},{""name"":""seedling"",""users"":[""U016C8XH6NR"",""U016C909613"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U017LMXPJF5""],""count"":4},{""name"":""woman-raising-hand"",""users"":[""U0172CB3649"",""U0169JE8HV5"",""U017LMXPJF5""],""count"":3},{""name"":""heart"",""users"":[""U017EGEH0SC"",""U017LMXPJF5""],""count"":2}]",17

Grateful for the opportunity to be here! My name is Evan, and it is nice to see all of your introductions! I am a software developer based out of Washington DC, USA currently working full time as a software engineer building security tooling at IOV Labs. Outside of my day job, I have recently spent a lot of time thinking about the intersection of the environment and technology.

I recently consumed Netflix's documentary series Dirty Money where an episode on the company Formosa focused on big corp environmental impact seriously pissed me off, and caused me to conduct research into environmental law and technologically progressive technology companies.

While conducting this research, I discovered an inspiring company based out of France called <https://planetwatch.io/|PlanetWatch>. Their Algorand based environmental sensor is only in beta (and they do not appear to be overly responsive to people looking to join the beta :disappointed: ), so I am curious about creating alternative products that strive towards leveraging web 3 technologies to improve the quality and robustness of environmental monitoring systems (think Citizen Science crossed with web 3).

I hope to contribute software development as well as my passion for technology and the environment to Kernel, whether that be through pursuing some already existing project or finding like minded individuals to craft more widely available solutions similar in mission to what PlanetWatch is pursuing.
