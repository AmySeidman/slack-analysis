We are excited to share that we’ve started building our Decentralized Authentication standard (dAuth) to enable app developers to sign users in without collecting/keeping emails or even crypto wallet addresses, delegating the authentication entirely to the user and enabling a higher level of security for everyone. 

*We would love to connect with you if you would like to consider Silkey dAuth for your application. We are prepared to work with your team to implement it and take it to production.* 

Join our <#C017UCDRS05|project-silkey> If you have any feedback for us or would like to stay updated on our project progress.

I want to thank publicly <@U01691XLMD5> <@U0172CM3049> <@U016KTNL5QW> and <@U017ECUHDGQ> for making some great recommendations for resources and tools they use regularly. These are the first community recommendations to be included on <https://kernel.community/tools>

The idea of this public website is to make sure that the syllabus we explore together, and iterate on as a community, gets shared with the wider public. It's critical that we gather all the knowledge and expertise - as well as everything which emerges from the meeting of minds and hearts - into a durable place that anyone can benefit from. So, if you have any tools or recommendations that have _genuinely_ changed how you work, that you use every day, or that shifted significantly the way you look at the world, please feel free to either share them with me or simply create a PR to the open source repo: <https://github.com/andytudhope/kernel>

NOTE: these must be things you _really, really_ use often and which have made a large impact in your life; otherwise this will become just another long list of links no-one ever bothers to read in full.

On a tangential note, I know there are a lot of people in here interested in education and various sub-themes around it. While I did not have the time or resources to build out the complete educational dream, I thought I would share some resources which I think all online education platforms can and should learn from. The first is about <https://lvp.digitalpromiseglobal.org/|Learner Variability>. The interactivity of this site is a cut above the rest, as is the research on which it is all based. I adore the split between Factors and Strategies and the general way it all fits together. Watch this <https://vimeo.com/365879421|video> to understand more. Then explore the actual <https://digitalpromise.org/|digital promise> :wink:

If you're into slightly more advanced education, then <https://numinous.productions/ttft/|this essay is the place to start>.
