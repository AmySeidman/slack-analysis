Hey everyone we at <#C017LH1M3JA|project-dfame> wanna onboard the first users to a private and closed test run within the next week. Hopefully starting on Monday. to give feedback, learn, and develop the product directly with users. Generally, it would be great if you already have a roll wallet or would like to create one. Currently, there will be only one community but we work to get more social tokens on the platform as soon as possible.

So if you are excited about social money, community tokenization, etc. and. would like to be early tester pleas contact us in the <#C017LH1M3JA|project-dfame> channel or sign up through the website and mention that you come from Kernel:pray::seedling:

1596148170.212800,U017E885WBA,"Hi Kernel fellows,

wanted to show a video prototype we are currently validating with some content creators, we want feedback on a few fronts.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Tk3RF_SAw&amp;feature=youtu.be>
What you see in the video is a payment in Layer 2 under a second and could be as small as a cent of a dollar.
A few things we want to validate:
• Is this better for content creators? what are the problems they have right now for donations and sponsorships? how much pain is there on those payment platforms? 
• would users that watch streaming content want to interact live with the screen they are watching (twitch meets satoshis.place type of deal)?
• we are talking about instant payments as little as 1 cent of a USD which AFAIK is not possible with paypal and such + you cant affect live content with paypal.
• These dynamic widgets could be anything, a poll, a banner, etc. This is to get feedback on the idea and also talk to twitch streamers and other content creators.
We want to incentivize people switching to layer 2 and think just transfers is BORING and not enough for people to use it _yet_.
This was inspired by the kernel module on money as speech <https://kernel.community/module-0/money-language/>
We started asking the question, why cant i sent money to a live event like i type text in a chat box or send an emoji? why cant i change and even impact the content i am watching with live payments?

Any feedback or questions are appreciated, :pray: also our channel is <#C017QNU0U5C|project-stablepay> if you want to chat.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:22:28 GMT",1596148170.212800,,"[{""name"":""heavy_check_mark"",""users"":[""U017E2A2KPS"",""U016T0QSCMT""],""count"":2}]",2

I'm talking from another point "" non technical point"" I know this an issue and we need to work on it to make people's lives much easier. I mean the abstracted idea. people love to be in one of two comfort zones
1- you are FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE do whatever you want , no rules, no limit ( freedom without responsibility) "" who might love the pain ?""
2- you are so limited , it's danger outside &amp; I will keep you safe, I'm responsible for  your safety and happiness but you have to follow me ( you have someone to blame)
most people don't like (freedom with responsibility) it's not comfort zone. we don't love to blame ourselves instead we love to blame someone else
if we just talk the crypto example :
 -saving money in banks ( bank own your money and have full control )  but bank is responsible for keeping your money safe.
-owning your money and have full control over it but with responsibility
and this is something unique about the meanings that blockchain has raised, "" freedom and responsibility "" as if it teaches us to take your freedom but be aware of the consequences "" responsibilities .","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:27:31 GMT",1596038428.199700,,,0

However, these pieces are meant to be ""discussions from first principles"". In this sense, it is my contention that freedom has nothing to do with ability, nor is it about being carefree, nor is it about options. Even in moments of intense inner expansiveness brought on by practices like holotropic breath work (for instance), we are still a) reliant on the practice itself, and b) limited both by that reliance as well as by fundamental aspects of our biology (no matter how much further out the limits actually are than what we're conditioned to believe).

Therefore, it is only a conscious appreciation of these limits, and a deeply responsible accounting of our role within them, which can bring us to experience lasting freedom as individuals. Of course, ""true"" freedom - in my book - is death, but that's perhaps another discussion :wink:","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:27:33 GMT",1596038428.199700,,,0
