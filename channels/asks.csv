There is a miscellaneous mix of other projects, like using NuCypher proxy reencryption or building our own platforms, but it’s highly contingent on the research interests of the faculty

1595432479.342700,U016Q0F66FM,"I hacked around with it for a weekend, so I can share some of my thoughts. There's probably plenty of misconceptions I'm making since I don't have the deepest of understanding of the protocol and my experience with it is rather brief.

It's a lot faster, more scalable, cheaper gas than ethereum. Time to finality is roughly 5-7 seconds, and the gas price is virtually unnoticeable from my experience with it. It also has the ability for people to build their own blockchains with unique core functionality using substrate, which is something (as I understand it) ETH2 won't necessarily support, though the vast majority of use cases don't need it's own blockhain. It's already out in mainnet after being relatively extensively tested in kusama, so it's cool to see a truly scalable layer one out in mainnet. In contrast, we still don't have to clear a date eth2 mainnet will be live in its full form, though perhaps for good reason because this sort of thing is important to get right early on. 

That being said the amount of parachains it can have is limited to the scalability of the relay chain. The relay chain also introduces some degree of centralization, and ymmv as far as your concern thereof. 

They other thing I did want to mention is that the devX for substrate is pretty bad. Atm the libraries and abstractions are quite clunky and hard to use unless you're quite familiar with the internals and really good at rust.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:10:32 GMT",1595407466.329800,,"[{""name"":""raised_hands"",""users"":[""U016T0QSCMT""],""count"":1},{""name"":""+1"",""users"":[""U016T0QSCMT""],""count"":1},{""name"":""heart"",""users"":[""U016T0QSCMT""],""count"":1},{""name"":""heavy_check_mark"",""users"":[""U016T0QSCMT""],""count"":1}]",4
