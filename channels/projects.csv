1599136651.000500,U017T22FUBF,"Hello All, 
We are excited to share that we’ve started building our Decentralized Authentication standard (dAuth) to enable app developers to sign users in without collecting/keeping emails or even crypto wallet addresses, delegating the authentication entirely to the user and enabling a higher level of security for everyone. 

*We would love to connect with you if you would like to consider Silkey dAuth for your application. We are prepared to work with your team to implement it and take it to production.* 

Join our <#C017UCDRS05|project-silkey> If you have any feedback for us or would like to stay updated on our project progress.

I interact with a lot of web2 people who assume all blockchain projects adhere to the fundamental blockchain values and adopt “centralized” platforms / frameworks / apps with decentralized tendencies or are labelled as blockchain (ex. Facebook’s Libra).

A website that lists all blockchain projects and verify how decentralized it is would be helpful in educating people in web2 and web3 space.

Yesterday we concluded all user interviews totaling 5 sessions. We are thankful to those attended and those couldn’t for various reasons.

The first round of user testing has helped us immensely, first validating our product value and second challenging the way we have thought of the product. As a result, we’re currently making serious iterations to overall user experience while building the core of Silkey MVP.

If you would like to get a sense of the prototype and share your feedback, please visit <http://silkey.io> and then connect your wallet to create your Silkey account. Once inside the dashboard, and with your wallet connected, test Silkey on any of the three mock websites to get a sense of what we are building.

We started Game3.js with a vision:

_5 to 10 years from now, what will fully realized Web 3.0 games look like?_

Today’s blockchain games are just the early iterations of Web 3.0 games. A fully realized Web 3.0 game will need to be more compelling than web, mobile, console, and VR games. Their virtual economies will need to have the same utility as those of sovereign fiat currencies. They will need to provide more meaning in people’s lives than just being a vehicle for intrusive ads and forced in-app purchases.

To achieve this vision, we need to bring in more builders, and make it as easy as possible for them to start building games in this new Web 3.0 world.

_KERNEL fellows!_ *I am looking for team members to join the following project (Thrivy)*

This idea came to me about 4 days ago, so it is very rough. But that means we can shape it together!

We have a bunch of Defi apps, and a lot of other interesting dapps built on Ethereum. The use case is pretty confined to a very limited set of people, though. There are a number of reasons for that.

We need retail adoption, to truly unlock the potential of blockchain / Ethereum. We need people buying groceries with crypto. We need them to pay for everyday services with crypto. The problem is immense, but someone has to solve it. And I am not going to give up, because I can see an incredible future if we do. Just think about how we can create better awareness, for example, about what people are buying in the shops (meat, poultry, etc.). What conditions those poor animals were in. By having traceability baked into the payments. This is absolutely *insane*. We will have to overcome regulatory hurdles. But from the technical perspective, I suppose we would start with some sorts of a reward system for retailers (to cut on their costs of maintaining any systems they may have / help them avoid printing paper and thus cutting down trees for those silly cards with stamps)

I will be having an initial call today in 2 hours and 30 minutes (14:00 BST) with someone (outside of KERNEL) who has agreed to help brainstorm and solidify the idea. Would you like to jump on a call too? We will use Miro, of course :slightly_smiling_face:

Retail adoption is just the first step

But it is a necessary step

I am so excited for what this will do and what other use cases and dapps this will spawn. We can create a better world *together*
