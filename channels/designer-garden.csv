1595432286.097500,U0176E6JUMA,"Hey friends, Andrej here from Deep Work! If you’ve been participating at the interactive workshop yesterday (interpreting user feedback and retrospective) and last week (prototyping and user testing) I just wanted to follow up with a few notes about yesterday.

*Here’s the board with all the examples you can use as a template and combine your own meeting flow:*
<https://miro.com/miroverse/category/workshops/meeting-legos>

*Why writing down negatives in general?*
This was a question I didn’t get to answer openly yesterday but in the exercise we started by writing down “things that didn’t go so well” or may be problematic regarding the product development. In the weekly retrospective, I would write down everything positive first, to make sure everyone sees what went well and has developed in a positive direction. This is important, because it shows whether the team is still on track. Afterwards, you write down all the things that didn’t go so well. They are equally (or even more) important because they highlight what you might have skipped or overlooked. It’s a powerful reality-check that will help you understand what doesn’t work and where to put more work in to stay on track.

*In the context of working with user feedback as a team*, instead of “writing out negatives”, start off by having the interviewer (who ran the interviews) presenting all answers, while everyone else writes down what resonates with them. That will give you a wall of post-its with the most important parts of the user feedback. You can then move on to prioritising them, finding solutions, doing the effort/impact scale, etc.

*On prototyping fast:*
<https://medium.com/deep-work-studio/how-to-prototype-anything-in-one-day-3d81a7f68e10>

*How to run usertests:*
<https://www.notion.so/deepworkstudio/How-to-run-user-tests-fast-0e3ea190c9a34afabeb7eef9fdd7ef69>

My 2 cents are on product is always start with the user and his experience and disregard at least at the start the ""how"" of the decentralization or underlying technology ala Steve Jobs. If the platform is useful or brings value you can figure out in phases how to decentralize.

See this:
<https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/>

But making a hard requirement full decentralization at the onset sacrificing experience may hinder the engagement or value to the users.
