I know we are late but we are building discord and tg bots that can connect your groups to Aragon DAO.
With the really well defined and well-implemented DAOs from Aragon, we can really make it easier to use, and we are positive that it is better than reinventing the wheel of making a new DAO framework.
Would love to know the feedback from you all, here is a  small demo, although its missing most features but we adding alot of features and it will be available soon.
