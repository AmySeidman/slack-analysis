1594334932.007800,U016Q0F66FM,"Thoughts
• It’s really hard to know that you like doing something until you actually do it. If we combine this with how the college-workplace pipeline works, you get a contradiction: it assumes that you know what you want to do before it lets you figure out what you want to do! I think this stems from the fact that our current education system is very linear.
• What if the future education system was an iterative instead of linear process? What if, instead of committing to a major and taking a pre-planned schedule, you constantly moved between school and the workplace, each time learning more about where your passions lie, each time refining the focus of your learning?
• How do we transition from our strict hierarchical system of learning to a network of learning while retaining quality and integrity in education?
","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 10:52:14 GMT",,,,0
1594334754.007500,U016Q0F66FM,"So here are my thoughts on the issue, somewhat consolidated, in addition to two separate ideas for something to build:

Problems
• Universities are expensive, exclusive, and oligopolistic
• University education doesn’t do a good job of helping people figure out what they want to do
• Course quality is highly dependent on the professor you get and limited in size
• MOOC’s do not provide a full educational ecosystem that’s necessary for meaningful educational experiences
• Universities are (for the most part) incompetent when it comes to providing real-world experience
Possible Ideas
• Set up a collection of courses, each of which use a DAO (or something like one) to bring together many instructors from many universities and incentivize more efficient / effective instruction and content.
• Create a mentorship / apprenticeship marketplace through which learners can gain hands-on experience concurrently with school. This can have a much lower cost, time commitment, and barrier to entry than an internship does while still providing meaningful experience.
