1595371401.137000,U016FDAC4LT,"Hey all,

I’m Shivam and I’m here to help Vivek and Sachin with operations for KERNEL. I’m just reaching out to help with scheduling Juntos. In order to schedule an event you have to do the following:

1. Type “/events create” in the Juntos channel, press enter &amp; start creating your event.
2. Use the (Airmeet link <https://www.airmeet.com/event/0d733160-bc9a-11ea-adb7-31ace487329c|here>) as the location. Or another link if you’d like.
3. In the description, make sure to write a bit about the topic / article you are basing your Junto on.
4. Make sure advanced options are toggled on and in the next step make sure RSVPs are on.
5. Try to create the event at least 72 hours before the kickoff so we can update the master schedule in time.
6. If you’re having any trouble with scheduling an event, shoot me a DM and I’d be more than happy to help you out.
Once a week, on Monday’s, I’ll post the master list of junto’s which are scheduled for the week so people can get a feel of the junto’s they could join with 2-7 other KERNEL cohort mates at any given time.

Best,
Shivam","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:09:31 GMT",1595371401.137000,,"[{""name"":""raised_hands"",""users"":[""U016WJZNNS0"",""U016HFP7P2A"",""U016H5ETT6J"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C909613"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U016PVCCZDG"",""U0169MFLKQF"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U0172CB3649"",""U016Z7XQC7N"",""U017E2A2KPS""],""count"":12},{""name"":""pray"",""users"":[""U016WJZNNS0"",""U016HFP7P2A"",""U016H5ETT6J"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C909613"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U0172CB3649"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U017E2A2KPS""],""count"":9},{""name"":""wave"",""users"":[""U016WJZNNS0"",""U016HFP7P2A"",""U016H5ETT6J"",""U016C909613"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U0172CB3649"",""U0172G1A28H"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U017E2A2KPS""],""count"":9}]",30

1594678480.073800,U016Q0F66FM,"I apologize for delay, here’s the list of analogies / useful oversimplifications I mentioned during the “Art of Conversation” Junto on friday:

• Blockchain Scalability without adoption is like building a stadium in a desert (Alex Skidanov)
• Crypto-native is like homebrew computer club - for adoption, we need people who, like Steve Jobs, can turn the new tech into something the average person who doesn’t care about or understand the tech will want to use.
• UTXO’s are Piggy Banks, where every time you spend money you smash it and put the change into a new one (Blockchain at Berkeley)
• What if you could mount the internet as a hard drive? That’s what IPFS is.
• New stuff is weird, but old stuff is just weird stuff you’re used to. (Vinay Gupta)
• In the labyrinth of Ideas, tech is what opens doors, use cases are like treasure chests hidden within (Balaji Srinivasan)
• Before, hardware controls software. With a blockchain, software also controls hardware. (Chris Dixon)
• Money is a language for value (Andreas Antonopoulous)
• Trust is like the deep end of a pool. Nobody wants to go into the deep end alone. (Simona Pop)
• To listen is to absorb the speakers consciousness while shelving your own.
Some of these are gross oversimplifications. Deep understanding in the end is most useful, and these things don’t lead to deep understanding, but on occasion, they are useful when trying to explain to someone why they should care about crypto. I’m sure others have better analogies they like to use to talk about crypto to people unfamiliar with it, especially non-technical - maybe we can use this thread to share some more?","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 10:57:58 GMT",1594678480.073800,,"[{""name"":""heavy_check_mark"",""users"":[""U017E2A2KPS"",""U016Q01RH5H"",""U017ECUHDGQ"",""U01753XEZTK"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U016W0C1FNG"",""U016X7E5G4U"",""U0172G1A28H"",""U016C909613"",""U01733WAA1F""],""count"":10},{""name"":""sparkles"",""users"":[""U0172CM3049"",""U016Q1J7Y83"",""U0169MFLKQF"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U016PUK3G9Z"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U016C909613"",""U01733WAA1F""],""count"":8},{""name"":""raised_hands"",""users"":[""U0169MFLKQF"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U016C909613""],""count"":4},{""name"":""100"",""users"":[""U017E2A2KPS"",""U016C909613""],""count"":2}]",24
