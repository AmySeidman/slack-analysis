Opensea (<http://opensea.io/>) is the largest exchange for these assets.

What I've used is a pluggin (`eth-gas-reporter`) for Truffle (if you're developing with truffle it may be an alternative) that checks the amount of gas used by each unit test.

It is useful to provide you an estimate of the amount of gas required for each method in your contract (as long as your tests really simulate the scenarios in which those methods will be called).
