_*MY THOUGHTS BELOW: From One KERNEL To Many*_ 

As we leave KERNEL, our hope is that one KERNEL leads to many. Practically, this means three steps for new projects. If you’ve done these, there’s still one big step I recommend below.

1. *Create your own Slack / Discord for your community.* Don’t do Telegram -- it’s never worth it to put all your conversations in one channel! 
2. <https://gitcoin.co/grants/new|Create a Gitcoin Grant>. Round 7 is upcoming with ~$100K in matching funds, but more importantly - great signal about who *really* cares about your project. If you receive $1 or $1,000 from someone -- invite them to your Slack, say hello. Involve them in the open source community around your project.
3. Start a Twitter presence. 
You can leverage your community (and KERNEL) to help grow each of these quickly.

To take it one step further --&gt; I think it’s entirely possible (and a high ROI investment) for each project here to host your own mini-KERNEL within a community of people hyper-interested in your projects or your ideas. Some simple ideas:

• A four week ‘book club’ for people interested in building in your domain, inviting the top 30 folks to join you. 
• A weekly community call hosted in an Airmeet or on Zoom. 
The key is to spend lots of time bringing in *great* people, and then focus on interactions *between* those people — not necessarily for you to be initiating all interactions.

This is accomplished by building Trust. Design your open source community for win-win scenarios, low miscommunication, and *repeat interactions*. This can be constructed. And it will help your projects grow, and I believe, if time permits, will be a true joy to foster.

Don’t forget to aim for diversity, and don’t forget that the quality of people matters much more than the quantity. I hope to see anyone who wants to discuss more tomorrow :slightly_smiling_face:","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:59:49 GMT",,,"[{""name"":""seedling"",""users"":[""U016X212QMA"",""U0172CB3649"",""U017E885WBA"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U0169JV8C95"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U016Q1TQAKV"",""U017G0TNCFN"",""U016PP38YLA"",""U016C909613"",""U017GN6FHQA"",""U0172CTQ3A5"",""U0172G1A28H"",""U0169MFLKQF"",""U016HFP7P2A"",""U016QSTSQQM""],""count"":17},{""name"":""sparkles"",""users"":[""U016X212QMA"",""U0172CB3649"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U017G0TNCFN"",""U016C909613"",""U017GN6FHQA"",""U016HFP7P2A""],""count"":9},{""name"":""heart"",""users"":[""U0172CB3649"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U017G0TNCFN"",""U016C909613"",""U017GN6FHQA"",""U016HFP7P2A""],""count"":8},{""name"":""clap"",""users"":[""U0172CB3649"",""U017E885WBA"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U017G0TNCFN"",""U016C909613"",""U016HFP7P2A""],""count"":8},{""name"":""bee"",""users"":[""U0172CB3649"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U017G0TNCFN"",""U016C909613"",""U016HFP7P2A""],""count"":7},{""name"":""antsreview"",""users"":[""U0172CB3649"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U017G0TNCFN"",""U016C909613"",""U016HFP7P2A""],""count"":7},{""name"":""heavy_plus_sign"",""users"":[""U017E2A2KPS"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U0172CB3649"",""U016Q1J7Y83"",""U016C909613"",""U016HFP7P2A""],""count"":7},{""name"":""party_parrot"",""users"":[""U016PP38YLA"",""U016C909613"",""U016HFP7P2A""],""count"":3}]",66

Week 7, our last, brings Vitalik Buterin for a fireside on *Giving* and *Scale-ability.* Andy will be here soon with the full module, but <https://vimeo.com/317296843|here’s a sneak peek> :wink:

More importantly, I’ve started hearing some <#C016DMGJ7SS|stories> from KERNEL Fellows about their experiences during Genesis Block. These make me happy to say the least. I do think it’s a great time to reflect on the time we’ve shared, to say a word to anyone who has impacted you in these 8 weeks, and to prepare for the rest of our lives together. There’s no leaving KERNEL now :spider_web::smile::deciduous_tree:

I want to start by thanking <@U016Q117G67> for his behind-the-scenes gifts scattered throughout the syllabus (there are *so many* left to explore). His birthday quietly passed recently (just as he’d like) and I want Andy to know that his :gift: is an otherworldly one — one that reminds me how futile giving with any thought of receiving is, and one that has completely changed the way I interact.

I am all up for it. Most of the people aren’t. Most of the people do not see the need for this and would resist

Was thinking about gamifying the Earth. There are a bunch of universal tokens representing different aspects of life that are crucial to keep in order. For example:

1. HEALTH - if you are healthy, you are more productive, you are happier, health institutions are less strained
2. ENVIRONMENT - recycling, not polluting the air and water keeps Earth happy, growing more trees
3. PROGRESS - are you becoming better than your yesterday’s self, are you growing as a human being
4. 
and so on

Whenever you unlock “achievements” in these broad categories, you get sent these tokens. You are incentivised to keep your health in check, to be kind to the people in your community, to progress, etc. If some of the communities aren’t where they need to be, we can incentivise them more by having “multipliers” such that if you complete the “achievement” you will get more tokens than elsewhere in the world / region

Anyone can choose to join in this protocol, there is no must. But the incentives would be in place to join","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:57:51 GMT",1598223637.014500,,"[{""name"":""point_up_2"",""users"":[""U016PEM9U5B""],""count"":1}]",1
