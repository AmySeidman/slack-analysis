1598587176.108600,U016C909613,"been a bit blown away with the messages and the comments after the fireside today. had to take a bit of time to reflect but i promise i hope to speak to many of you individually in the coming week or two. for now, simply thank you. 

i went to the park this evening for sunset, which rapidly turned into a thunderstorm. i actually flipped over my bicycle headfirst in the dash to get home :hushed: first time it’s ever happened (im thankfully 100% okay :slightly_smiling_face:

i watched les miserables this evening on Netflix as the storm passed. much suffering and hardship was displayed from the revolution. even still, one quote from the end of the movie stands out: 

“to love another person is to see the face of God”

amidst the failed revolution (and the reminder of the importance of evolution), the one saving grace in the movie was love between people. 

if im proud of one thing in KERNEL, it’s that we moved past typical internet words like “users”, or “participants” or “followers” towards seeing each other as people, as friends, and ultimately - with love. 

this feature will continue to guide KERNEL as we move forward. thanks for being here from the beginning and for sharing your energy. it’s the greatest gift and im excited to continue paying it forward. forever thankful for the Genesis Block :gift::slightly_smiling_face::heart:","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 12:03:07 GMT",1598587176.108600,,"[{""name"":""heart"",""users"":[""U016H5ETT6J"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U016Q0F66FM"",""U0172CM3049"",""U016PNPMFSN"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U0172CTQ3A5"",""U0182ST8XGB"",""U016Q1J7Y83"",""U016Z7XQC7N"",""U017EF8VBS4"",""U016PP38YLA"",""U0169JV8C95"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U0172CB3649"",""U016Q1TQAKV"",""U016BTBS3MM"",""U016HTJ5Q4W"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U01693HHP9V"",""U017E885WBA"",""U016QSTSQQM"",""U016Y4634MS"",""U0169FVV2LF"",""U016HFP7P2A"",""U016T0QSCMT"",""U0172G1A28H"",""U016M08G1M4"",""U017DKW89DW"",""U016WQPK6J0"",""U017HNKDHNV"",""U01692ECHKR""],""count"":32},{""name"":""seedling"",""users"":[""U016C8XH6NR"",""U016Q0F66FM"",""U0172CM3049"",""U016PNPMFSN"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U0182ST8XGB"",""U016Q1J7Y83"",""U016Z7XQC7N"",""U017EF8VBS4"",""U016PP38YLA"",""U0169JV8C95"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U0172CB3649"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U01693HHP9V"",""U017E885WBA"",""U016QSTSQQM"",""U016HFP7P2A"",""U016T0QSCMT"",""U0172G1A28H"",""U016M08G1M4"",""U017DKW89DW"",""U016WQPK6J0""],""count"":23},{""name"":""pray"",""users"":[""U017E2A2KPS"",""U0182ST8XGB"",""U0169JV8C95"",""U017DN0DZ08"",""U0172CB3649"",""U016HTJ5Q4W"",""U01733WAA1F"",""U01693HHP9V"",""U016QSTSQQM"",""U016HFP7P2A"",""U016T0QSCMT"",""U016QLH0DFV"",""U016C8XH6NR"",""U0172G1A28H"",""U016M08G1M4"",""U017DKW89DW"",""U016Q3TCF45"",""U016WQPK6J0""],""count"":18}]",73

I was curious about the actual equation that’s being solved, and it seems this is laid out in section 3 of the original paper your article links to.

I skimmed it briefly just now and it seems the goal is to maximize the total utility of a community—where utility is measured in units of currency—for a given budget constraint. A given funding level of a public good results in some corresponding utility level for each citizen. It was also interesting that it states they’re not trying to obtain an equitable distribution of utility, and instead just maximize total utility.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:12:29 GMT",1595526509.318200,,,0

 There are a few issues I find with the design:
1. We have to make sure the picture (tapestry) on the front is hi-res enough to be printed as big at 300dpi since it's a raster image
2. I think uniswap is written way too many times
3. The equations and all the design on the back including the graph and fonts used look more like a word document than something designed.
4. Maybe it's too much to have a unicorn on the front and other two different unicorns on the back, the one to the left I am not sure if it is a unicorn.

Overall I like the front and I feel that there's too much happening on the back and on the arms.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:12:59 GMT",1595543386.339800,,,0

I guess I was hoping that he found some sort of shortcut to making cool presentations, but I guess at the end of the day there are no shortcuts to knowledge. I'd still be curious as to his method/stack for making his presentations, but I guess that it would be yet another rabbit hole to add to the many others I've fallen down in the quest for being able to just do it myself.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:12:10 GMT",,U016Q117G67,,0

1595527000.324700,U016Q117G67,"1. <@U016HFP7P2A> - you fund the Gitcoin dev grant :wink: But also, I think that you could ping <@U016HPVFV54> about clr.fund (or <@U017VDU1T17> as I think he also is a part of that?)
2. <@U016BTBS3MM> I heard that it takes a long ass time, but definitely still shorter than his general Zoom backgrounds: <https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1253323692479623171>
3. I think you should definitely give that a go <@U0169476M7Z> - would be awesome to see, and potentially acts as an answer to 4.
4. Dominant Assurance is one, perhaps? But also, if you're clear about the social contract, you can achieve great things when the flow of value os handled in a public, auditable, accountable and predictable way,
5. This is what the nonlinear underlying funding principle is about - i.e. ""The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received."". This mechanism ensures that if you get a few big contributions from a few people, the matching amount is much smaller than if you get lots of small contributions from many people.
6. <@U016SKSLW9G> I know that the Gitcoin team does have some mechanisms which switch the UI around and mix things up as this was a discussion from Round 2 or 3. Will leave them to detail more. The UI always matters though :wink: 
7. The matching amount comes from some prearranged fund atm - i.e. Vitalik and others. In future, we could hopefully use protocol-derived funds, or some more algorithmic/automated manner.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:12:07 GMT",,,"[{""name"":""heart"",""users"":[""U016C8XH6NR"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U016AMDF215""],""count"":3},{""name"":""joy"",""users"":[""U016ZPHMHL4"",""U0169476M7Z"",""U017E2A2KPS"",""U016AMDF215"",""U016W05TXUL"",""U016QFUSBRB""],""count"":6}]",9
