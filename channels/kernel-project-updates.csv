We will be holding these events monthly should you ever want to join us.:seedling:All are always welcome and happy to introduce you to our growing family of Rare Ones:-) Also open to collabs/co-meets and the like with other growing communities in the KERNEL.

I have a feeling that the numbers are prohibitively exorbitant. I have like 1k DAI that I’m not investing because it is too expensive. How can a person with £0.5 invest then. Someone suggested using xDAI. Perhaps it is a way. I don’t know enough about it. I think DSR gets locked up and that mints xDAI and then chai is the interest bearing part in the bridge.
