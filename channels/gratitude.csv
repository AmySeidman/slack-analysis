1599410756.144100,U01692ECHKR,"Hello, excuse me for being so late to the party. I was out in the boonies (no internet) and then moving across town... I cannot believe Kernel is already over. It was sometimes tough for me to participate due to time zones but I tried to make it work the best it could. Like others, it meant that I missed some pretty interesting discussions but I was happy to listen to recordings later. It was 'tough' to work through Kernel with a hardware project, especially seeing the heavy ETH focus (in a good way)! It was fun nonetheless and got some feedback I still have to work through. As an upside, we recently applied for a grant to take the first steps into taking int into production. We aim to incorporate in Singapore due to logistic and strategic reasons, as our researched showed that Asia is the fastest growing hardware market. I talked and received feedback from many people, and for that you have my thanks! To all the others I did not get a chance to talk, perhaps we see each other in a next round. I will stick around in these Slack channels for as long as they continue to exist. I debated joining APOLLO but with some of the stuff coming up, it is too much to manage. I'd love to keep in touch or if anyone wants to reach out and join the fun. Interested in talking to people from all backgrounds. Also, we are open to investment opportunities. Cheers all!

Yesterday <https://kernel-community.slack.com/archives/C016JL4385C/p1597168559023300|evening>, we had a match-made-in-heaven :cloud: Junto with 2 esteemed guests speakers, <@U017RGJ7KAA> (CTO) from <https://www.blocknative.com/|Blocknative> and <@U01785AMRR9> (CEO) from <https://www.covalenthq.com/|Covalent>.  The following two case studies / pre-reads were recommended and helped aid the lively discussion.
1. <https://blog.blocknative.com/blog/mempool-forensics|Mempool forensics> :bowl_with_spoon: 
2. <https://www.covalenthq.com/blog/covalent-defi-sdk/|Covalent SDK> :alembic: 
While Chris explored the ideas of _value in motion_  :star2:  covering mempool traffic :vertical_traffic_light: analytics and notifications :1234: with us. Ganesh balanced the remaining from where Chris left off by exploring _value at rest_ :cake: with smart-contracts &amp; transactions analytics.

We also gained valuable insights on historically underlooked mempool data while taking into consideration the performance of the different kinds of nodes in the Ethereum :city_sunset: network including but not limited to how they skew any assumptions on transaction (type) distribution that we might make. Active nonce :1234: and gas price :fuelpump: management for stuck, pending and dropped, mempool transaction :swimmer: and block explorers :building_construction: data stores. We further explored on-chain data usage for delivering insights by restructuring it into a consumable formats while covering topics like EVM  :nerd_face: optimisations, performance considerations in DB latency vs verifiability :checkered_flag: rollups :space_invader: vs single row :table_tennis_paddle_and_ball: lookups, OLTP and OLAP databases, and DB primitives :construction_worker:. The overarching theme was on how we could bridge the legacy DB :steam_locomotive: world onto blockchain :bullettrain_front: and how the technologies weâ€™re building could aid that vision.

Effectively this junto covered the entire spectrum of the happenings in the life of an Ethereum transaction :money_with_wings: and the value that it carries every step of the way. :roller_coaster: I  would highly recommend reaching out to the mentors for anything (even remotely) related to data on blockchain and look forward to our next Junto on one or more of the discussed specifics. <@U016C8XH6NR> thanks a ton for organising this and to all the participants for engaging!
