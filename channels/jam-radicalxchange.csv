1596148343.011600,U017E885WBA,"Hi all,

I just posted this question on another channel but wanted to also bring some discussion here on the video.
<https://kernel-community.slack.com/archives/C017A7P3UE4/p1596148170212800>

We are exploring the idea of a live streamer screen as being like a property or land, so would a system to buy that property live instantly would make sense for a Harberger Tax or another type of auction.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Tk3RF_SAw&amp;feature=youtu.be>
This is the video to get an idea of the concept.

Would like to hear some thoughts.
