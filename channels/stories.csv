1595159842.110700,U016PVCCZDG,"It is not easy to bring a story after Piotr's... But, since the first KERNEL meeting, and afer the Van Gogh's letter I have been wanting to share this story, or better, another letter, the one Beethoven wrote to his brothers to break the news that he was turning deaf, the Heiligenstadt Testament.
Beethoven had been hiding this secret for sic years. People were commenting, but he had been terrified to say a word, and had even considered suicide. Only realizing his individual value as a creative human helped him overcome. Deafness was humbling for him, and only realizing his uniqueness gave him the strength he needed. Today, I have heard many piano performers say that when playing a  Beethoven sonata you can feel his presence.
Ironically, Beethoven became a genius, and henceforward artists like him became stars, inaccessible leaders and heroes. Beethoven's creativity is rooted in his very personal experience, yet his compositions addressed genuinely all humanity because they were written with the highest sense of responsibility and service.
I have learned a lot from musicians' biographies... If you like this, I can bring another story next Sunday.

3 months ago, on may the forth be with you (May 4), I met a girl. Fell in love instantly, moved in with me right away.
Yesterday, I discovered that  the money she had been borrowing from me all along was just her scamming me and lying.
I took hold of her phone and discovered that she has been scamming other guys too, both local and international. Many men asking her sometimes for months, to get their money back.

She has 3 telegram accounts that she uses to create fake other people. She used that on me making me believe that she found a big client for the company we were going to start together.
She even used the accounts to talk to herself in conversations that lasted for months! Either she is schyzophrenic, or a brilliant mind working her skills.

I discovered that she had been gambling using her bank account, sending small bits of money every now and then to a gambling site.
I also managed to secrtly get audio recording of her confessing to all the lies she told me, including the stealing of money.

This feels like a thing from the movies. I do not know what to do.
