• *NLU attack vectors on legacy and crypto value chains (AntsReview use-case)*: the cost-benefit trade-off of using AI to attack/subvert review processes and human-agent based validation processes. Can we devise hard protections against hybrid bot-human adversaries or do we need to rely on prohibitive cost as our main line of defense?
• *2019 talk recap of SaaS autonomous agents x Token Engineering:*  AI agents following economic objectives are within grasp now. Why isn't adoption coming faster? Are ethical concerns holding people back? Is reinforcement learning a necessary part of on-chain agents?
• *Content Validation in Reputation Systems - GPT3 as a baseline tool that is part of the ecosystem value flow?:* validation steps (e.g. certain roles/functions in a DAO setting) can be split into separate categories where AIaaS fills the roles of the more mundane aspects and human validators are pooled into ""resource pools"" for the more demanding and engaging tasks.","Mon, 19 Jan 1970 11:39:12 GMT",1597152286.014200,,"[{""name"":""+1"",""users"":[""U01691XLMD5""],""count"":1},{""name"":""seedling"",""users"":[""U0172CB3649""],""count"":1}]",2
